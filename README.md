# Download mp3s with Python

I wanted to download some mp3s for my Mom, which are available for free at
[this website](http://www.kazaniaksiedzapiotra.pl/). I didn't feel like doing it manually, so I've written this simple
program, to do that for me.

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sitek94/download-mp3s-with-python

# Setup virtual environemnent, install dependencies and run the program
make run
```
